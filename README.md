**Descrition:**
I am currently working on a research conference management  
system as a solo project, which will allow papers to be reviewed by a  
minimum of 5 reviewers before being accepted or rejected for  
publication. As the sole developer, I am responsible for  
implementing all key features, including user authentication and  
authorization, paper submission and review workflows, and search  
functionality.  
To accomplish this, I am utilizing my skills in Spring, React.js and  
MySQL to build a responsive user interface and a robust back-end  
system that will allow reviewers to bid on papers, and authors to  
upload and download paper files, and conference chairs to manage  
the review process. Additionally, I am conducting thorough testing  
and debugging to ensure that the system functions as intended and  
meets project requirements.  
Once completed, the system will allow Admin to CRUD User and  
Profile, Search for User, and View Active/Non-active User. Authors  
will be able to CRUD Paper, Upload PDF as the paper, Download the  
Paper for review, and Read All Reviews for that paper. Reviewers will  
be able to CRUD Review, Hide/Unhide paper in Pending status,  
Bid/Unbid paper, View Bid status, and Download the Paper file.  
Conference Chairs will be able to Accept/Reject Bid, Auto allocation  
of Bid, Repending the accepted/rejected Bid, Accept/Reject Paper,  
and View paper by Pending/Accept/Reject.  
This project has allowed me to showcase my proficiency in full-stack  
web development and project management.  
Through my efforts, I am confident that I will be able to deliver a  
functional and user-friendly software product that will meet the  
needs of conference organizers and attendees alike.
