**Install**  
1. Java just run Maven with ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```  
2. For React.js, Run   
```npm install``` lastly, run with  ```npm start```   
Run this line if material/ui is causing problem   
```npm config set legacy-peer-deps true``` then do   
```npm install``` lastly, run with  ```npm start```   


***Set up***   

For PostgreSQL set-up, can skip since i'm already hosting in render    
but since it a free tier, speed might be slower than Local  
To setup locally, just need to grab the script name ```postgreSQL.sql``` in the project and use it.     
and change the datasource url, username and password in application properties

to change to Local Back-end, just switch the url in the ```AxiosUrl.js```
